# 🧠 C++ Projects – Core Logic, Clean Implementation

Welcome to my collection of C++ projects built purely for the love of problem-solving and low-level logic design.

These aren't just basic "Hello World" programs — each project is crafted with care, optimized for performance, and structured to be reused as **backend logic** in modern applications.

## 🌟 Why This Repo?

As a developer deeply passionate about both **development** and **algorithms**, I often build from scratch using C++ — not just to solve problems, but to truly *understand* them.

These projects are:
- 🛠️ Modular and cleanly written
- 🔁 Reusable as backend logic or open-source APIs
- 💡 Useful for devs who want real-world logic beyond tutorials

## 📁 Projects Included

| Project         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| 🔢 `Factorial`      | Calculates the factorial of large numbers using string multiplication (handles overflow like a boss 💪) |
| 🧮 `Calculator`     | A custom-built calculator handling operations step by step — useful as core logic for backend math apps |
| 🔲 `Sudoku Solver` | Solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. Optimized and well-commented |
| 🧪 `More Coming`    | Stay tuned for prime checks, equation solvers, and more logic-based mini-engines |

## 🔗 How to Use

### ✅ As a Dev/Student
- Clone the repo and use the logic in your own projects
- Study the code for learning algorithms and problem-solving in C++

### 🌐 As a Backend Logic Layer
You can wrap these functions in a **Node.js API** (via C++ bindings) and call them from:
- React apps
- Backend systems
- Public utility APIs

(*Coming soon: a guide on turning these into open APIs!*)

## 🤝 Contributions & Collaboration

Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or ask for new logic implementations!  
This is a personal hobby project, but I'm always down to collaborate with fellow devs who love grinding the logic layer.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a developer who finds joy in both *front-end experiences* and *deep backend logic*.  
Currently building full-stack projects, preparing for hackathons, and laying the foundation for future startup ideas — all while keeping C++ close to the heart.
